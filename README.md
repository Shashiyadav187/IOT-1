# IOT
IOT Arduino, Node.js and Plotly
 I will introduce the building blocks for creating a simple IoT application. 
 To do this, I will use an Arduino microcontroller with a photocell (light intensity sensor), a node.js server for capturing and transferring the data, and a cloud service called plotly to visualise the data. 
 By the end of this tutorial, we will have a functioning IoT application that you can customise to other use-cases.
